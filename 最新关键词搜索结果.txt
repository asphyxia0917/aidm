Also in 2017, Travis Scott goaded a fan to leap from a second-floor balcony at New York’s Terminal 5.

“I see you, but are you gonna do it?” Scott said. “They gonna catch you, don’t be scared! Fall!”

The fan ended up breaking both of his legs.

In addition, Travis Scott is listed as an organizer of AstroWorld. The truth will come out years later in court. It’s not OK for any person to go to a concert and get trampled on. He didn’t even help the ambulance safely go out of the concert. Minimal he could’ve done that.

Travis Scott is in a lawsuit. Who advised him to actually do an interview is nuts. He should just keep his mouth shut. He did not look good. And no one saying it’s 100% his fault. He is partially responsible. But he will not take any responsibility. That’s the issue! 10 DEAD!!

Travis Scott should not be responsible for all this chaos. (*unless he specifically made the decision to over capacitate the venue.) The venues staff + The crowd + The parents of that child are responsible. And they are going pretty low to try to place blame on TS.

3. Of course, child sacrifice is supposed to be illegal in the USA. But apparently Houston, Texas doesn't think so. Maybe iHeart funded the sheriff and attorney general's fraudulent wins. I mean, they didn't fire Travis Scott for his other rituals. Houston will suffer for this.

Our denial of objective morality is so great that Travis Scott can say "I'm a man of God" in an interview about the people who were killed at his satanic concert.

And few of us will bat an eyelash.
