You're not responsible for deaths & injuries at your Houston concert for which you, Blake & Astroworld have been sued? You were found guilty & paid fines for prior incident, but learned zip. Why didn't anyone inform you via earpiece? You can't absolve yourself of guilt.

There are times when “The Show Must Go On” DOES NOT apply.

Yours and your fans actions were utterly disgusting. There are parents out there who have to see and know that a concert carried on *without hesitation* around their child’s dead body.

My son was at the bottom of one of the human piles. He was crushed. While he survived, many around him did not. They were all screaming for help and to stop the show. You did not and you, the crew, venue and promoters will  be held responsible.

Bless your heart..they can't find you responsible.
It happened in 2019...so the Venue hasn't learned. 
You stopped and showed concern as soon as you realized it was serious. Lastly, the crowd rushed, and it wasn't you who caused it. Sad for the losses for sure..not on u baby! Folded hands

Why are these concerts allowed to get this crowded? Way too many people. Got to get those ticket sales no matter the cost......smh

After your recent album, I think ive given up. I’ve fought through thick and thin, tirelessly defending your music.But now, you’ve fallen off so hard i don’t think i can fight anymore. When i defended your recent album, i was bullied for weeks, I’m sorry but you just lost a fanSneezing face
